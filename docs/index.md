# Welcome to clair-torch

This site contains the documentation for `clair-torch`, an open-source Python project for providing methods
to quantify a digital camera's linearity with respect to the incident light intensity on the sensor. The project also
enables the user to solve a digital camera's (inverse) response function, allowing linearization of images and quantitatively
well-defined merging of exposure series into an HDR image.

At this point the project is still WIP and hasn't reached a 1.0.0 release state yet. Therefore, many things are still
subject to change significantly before a stable public API is finalized.

When public versioning is started, a changelog will be maintained in the [Changelog file](../CHANGELOG.md)

Main things still missing are:
1. Stable finalized public API
2. Some unit tests
3. End-to-end tests.
4. Large sections of the documentation.
5. CI/CD features of the repository.
6. Commandline interface for sample scripts.
